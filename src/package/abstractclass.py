"""
The first step is to import libraries required for developing your module. This 
example shows the creation of an abstract class which cannot be created using the 
default python libraries. Hence, the abc module needs to be imported. This module 
contains the methods typically required for creating an abstract class.

    created directly from an abstract class, but from child classes of the abstract class.
